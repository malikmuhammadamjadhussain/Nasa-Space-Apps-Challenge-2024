        <h2>Some Of The Major Greenhouse Gases</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming. These gases result from human activities like burning fossil fuels, agriculture, and industrial processes, causing temperature rises, climate change, and environmental disruptions worldwide.</p>

                <h3>Carbon dioxide</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Carbon dioxide is a colorless and non-flammable gas at normal temperature and pressure. Although much less abundant than nitrogen and oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide is an important constituent of our planet's air. A molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) is made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.

                Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas that helps to trap heat in our atmosphere. Without it, our planet would be inhospitably cold. However, an increase in CO2 concentrations in our atmosphere is causing average global temperatures to rise, disrupting other aspects of Earth's climate.
                
                Carbon dioxide is the fourth most abundant component of dry air. Today it has a concentration of over 400 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere. Before industrial activity, there was around 270 ppm in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere have thus risen about 40% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, which is raising global temperature.
                
                
                
                Since 1958, scientist Charles Keeling and others have measured the amount of carbon dioxide in Hawaii's atmosphere. The yearly fluctuations in carbon dioxide are due to seasonal plant growth, while the overall rise in carbon dioxide over many years is due to a combination of fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and cement production.

                <h3>Methane</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Methane (CH4) is a hydrocarbon that is the primary component of natural gas and a very potent and important greenhouse gas (GHG). Unlike other GHGs, methane can be converted to usable energy. Capturing and using methane offers opportunities to generate new sources of clean energy and mitigate global climate change.

                Methane's Role in Global Warming:
               Like emissions of other GHGs, emissions of methane due to human activities (anthropogenic emissions) have increased markedly since pre-industrial times. The global atmospheric concentration of methane has grown from a preindustrial value of about 715 parts per billion (ppb) to 1,782 ppb in 2007 — a nearly 150-percent rise and far above the natural range of the last 650,000 years.1 Global anthropogenic methane emissions are projected to increase nearly 20 percent to 8,522 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2E) by 2030.2
               
               Of the GHGs emitted as a result of human activities, methane is the second most important GHG after carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for 14 percent of global GHG emissions in 2005.3 Though methane is emitted into the atmosphere in smaller quantities than CO2, its global warming potential (i.e., the ability of the gas to trap heat in the atmosphere) is 25 times that of CO2, resulting in methane's stronger influence on warming during its 12-year atmospheric life time.

                <h3>Nitrous Oxide</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Like other greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide absorbs radiation and traps heat in the atmosphere, where it can live for an average of 114 years, according to the EPA. That puts it in a sort-of middle ground of super pollutants.

                Compared with carbon dioxide, which can live in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, nitrous oxide is around a relatively short time. But it stays in the atmosphere longer than other short-lived climate pollutants like black carbon (which exists in the atmosphere for days) or methane (which is around for 12 years).
                
                Nitrous oxide also poses a second threat: while in the stratosphere, nitrous oxide is exposed to sunlight and oxygen which converts the gas into nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides can damage the ozone layer, which humans rely on to prevent most of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation from reaching earth’s surface.
                
                That double-threat effect results in the gas’s potency. One pound of N2O warms the atmosphere about 300 times the amount that one pound of carbon dioxide does over a 100 year timescale. Its potency and relatively long life make N2O a dangerous contributor to climate change.
                
                 Where Does Nitrous Oxide Come From? 
                About 40 percent of nitrous oxide emissions come from human activities, and of those, the majority are from the way we use land—particularly agriculture.</p>

                <h3>Chlorofluorocarbons</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are nontoxic, nonflammable chemicals containing atoms of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine. They are used in the manufacture of aerosol sprays, blowing agents for foams and packing materials, as solvents, and as refrigerants. CFCs are classified as halocarbons, a class of compounds that contain atoms of carbon and halogen atoms. Individual CFC molecules are labeled with a unique numbering system. For example, the CFC number of 11 indicates the number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, and chlorine (e.g. CCl3F as CFC-11). The best way to remember the system is the "rule of 90" or add 90 to the CFC number where the first digit is the number of carbon atoms (C), the second digit is the number of hydrogen atoms (H), and the third digit is number of the fluorine atoms (F). The total number of chlorine atoms (Cl) are calculated by the expression: Cl = 2(C+1) - H - F. In the example CFC-11 has one carbon, no hydrogen, one fluorine, and therefore 3 chlorine atoms.

                Refrigerators in the late 1800s and early 1900s used the toxic gases, ammonia (NH3), methyl chloride (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), as refrigerants. After a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s when methyl chloride leaked out of refrigerators, a search for a less toxic replacement begun as a collaborative effort of three American corporations- Frigidaire, General Motors, and Du Pont.

                <h3>Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Sulphur hexafluoride – also known as SF6 – is a ‘greenhouse gas’ that has long played a part in global warming, similar to that of carbon dioxide (CO2).

                CO2 has been a focal point of climate change for many years. Released from the burning of fossil fuels and other carbon-intensive practices, it creates a cover that traps heat from the sun in the earth’s atmosphere, warming the planet and the oceans. This is what’s known as the ‘greenhouse effect’.
                
                SF6 also has this effect, but is much more potent than CO2. Today, wider understanding of the potency of this gas – and the need to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in order to tackle climate change – is causing a rethink of its use.
                
                
                 What is SF6 greenhouse gas? 
                SF6 is a synthetic, odourless gas that’s used in the electricity industry to keep networks running safely and reliably. It’s highly stable, non-toxic, non-flammable and electronegative, which means it will not form other compounds that will alter its state and effectiveness.
                
                SF6 has historically been used in a variety of applications, from metal smelting to filling double-glazing panels, but the electricity industry is one of the few places where it’s still used today; due to the technical challenges in replacing it. And it’s used on such a scale that it’s become a serious contributing factor to global warming."
                
                 Why is SF6 harmful to the atmosphere? 
                SF6 is one of the most potent greenhouse gases we know.

                <h3>Nitrogen trifluoride</h3>
              </a>
              <p>Nitrogen trifluoride is a greenhouse gas not regulated by the Kyoto Protocol, but has a global warming potential 17,200 times greater than carbon dioxide. It is released during the manufacturing of flat-panel screens.

                Summary from Source
                Warning! The below summary is autogenerated by a custom alogrithm from the source given below. It is only guaranteed to be accurate 75% of the time.
                Nitrogen trifluoride is the inorganic compound with the formula NF3. This nitrogen-fluorine compound is a colorless, nonflammable gas with a slightly musty odor. Nitrogen trifluoride is an extremely strong greenhouse gas. Nitrogen trifluoride is a rare example of a binary fluoride that can be prepared directly from the elements only at very uncommon conditions, such as electric discharge. After first attempting the synthesis in 1903, Otto Ruff prepared nitrogen trifluoride by the electrolysis of a molten mixture of ammonium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride. It proved to be far less reactive than the other nitrogen trihalides nitrogen trichloride, nitrogen tribromide and nitrogen triiodide, all of which are explosive. Alone among the nitrogen trihalides it has a negative enthalpy of formation. Nitrogen trifluoride is used in the plasma etching of silicon wafers.
                
                
                Today nitrogen trifluoride is predominantly employed in the cleaning of the PECVD chambers in the high-volume production of liquid-crystal displays and silicon-based thin-film solar cells.</p>
